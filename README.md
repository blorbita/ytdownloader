# ytdownloader
The way to run this if not already clear is to simply open your terminal, 
and paste the following command with the replacement of said placeholders,
python YT_TO_MP4.py "VIDEO LINK"
it should automatically download in highest quality, any tips for improvement are highly appreciated as I am a beginner.
